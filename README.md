## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Principal Systems Engineer passionate about building reliable, intelligent systems. With deep experience in Python, PHP, and cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) and AIOps, I thrive on solving complex challenges at scale.

When I'm not working on distributed systems or automation, you’ll probably find me getting my hands dirty with project cars—sometimes it’s good to take a break from the screen and build something with tools instead of code.
